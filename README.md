# Helper Scripts for NavCom

This is a collection of scripts that TAs/researchers/sysadmins setting up the infrastructure of the  Navigating Complexity course can use to make their life easier. These include scripts for creating accounts in 4CAT, making database backups, notebooks for creating word networks, useful resources, and documentation about the set-up and use of different digital methods relevant to the course.

Each folder contains a tool with their respective documentation
